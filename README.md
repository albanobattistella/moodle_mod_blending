## BLENDING - for Older Students with Severe Reading Deficits



**BENDING** provides interactive blending and phonics for tutor-led *intensive* interventions for older students still reading at grade-1 or -2 level.

Most middle-school classrooms have at least one student who cannot make sense of a grade-2 chapterbook; they have stalled and will make no further progress without an intensive intervention.  The research is clear: almost all students become strong, competent readers with proper instruction. This program specifically addresses the needs of older students.

**BLENDING** is a tutor-led intensive one-on-one intervention for these students.  It requires no special skills and can be led by EAs, parents, or even student volunteers.  The software provides hints for the tutors, progress monitoring, record-keeping, and continual formative assessments.

An intensive intervention prescribes one-on-one tutoring for at least an hour per day, ideally two hours, at least five days a week. This program requires about ten weeks of DAILY practice - about 20 minutes per day for drills, plus increasing reading and writing practice.  By the end, the student will be prepared to read a grade-3 chapterbook (such as Goosebumps) independently.

Unsure if BLENDING is appropriate?  Try it for 20 minutes with your student.




## Older Students

Older students are not ‘emerging readers’ paused as if caught in amber.  They have continued to develop along a bumpy off-road track.  They have reading superpowers like larger vocabularies,  tenacious memory, and world knowledge, but also severe deficits.

But they also have severe deficits that are not addressed by programs for emerging readers.

Severe-deficit older students exist on a wide spectrum.  Some are those unable to read the simplest texts, and barely know the common sounds of the alphabet consonants.

A more common group appears to ‘read’, they know how to decode and can attack a short passage, but using memorized words and guessing. The most common 300 words account for about half the words on any page, and these students have memorized that much and more. They guess from context, first- and last-letters, word shape, and picture clues. They have honed these skills to extraordinary levels. This kind of reading is effortful and error-prone. Small errors mangle comprehension.  A guessing student will not be able to attend to the meaning of a text or have the endurance to complete it.

All these students are similar in one respect; they struggle to blend and segment the sounds of spoken language.  We call this skill ‘Phonological Awareness’ as if awareness was sufficient.  This skill must be overlearned to mastery until it is fluent, accurate, automatic, and involuntary.

These students are also similar in another respect; they develop self-sabotaging behaviors like low self-esteem and learned helplessness.  They learn to cope and to hide their deficits. This can all be repaired in a single semester with an intensive intervention.


## About **BLENDING**

**BLENDING** consists of about 100 gently progressive lessons with 5-10 tabs each, starting with the five short vowels to build 'phonological awareness' skills.  Lessons include pronounciation, contrasts, memory overloads, [wordspinners](https://communityreading.org/wp/try-the-wordspinner/), affix lessons, non-content words, and decodable texts with varying levels of assistance. The last tab of each lesson is a formative assessment.
