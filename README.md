# Blending #

This is a Moodle plugin for tutor-led training of blending and segmenting skills.  It provides about 150 gently-progressive Blending drills and exercises, designed for older students (grade 4 and up) with severe reading deficits.

The purpose of these drills is to help a student transition from using memorized words and guessing to sounding out. Blending and segmenting skills are the basis of ‘phonological processing’, and the lack of these skills is the basic characteristic of Dyslexia. But these are just skills, and skills can be taught and learned.

BLENDING starts by teaching three-letter words like ‘cat’ and ‘dog’ using the five short vowels, then introduces consonant clusters and consonant digraphs using the same five short vowels, for example ‘chat’ and ‘blink’.  These drills are not intended to teach a child to read ‘cat’ and ‘dog’ – chances are that they can already do that. But if they cannot segment or blend with confidence and automaticity, then they will tend to rely on memorized words instead. That isn’t real reading, and must be corrected. These drills will help change that behavior.

The key to success with Blending is INTENSITY. You should only use these drills for 15-20 minutes per day but your student needs to practice EVERY DAY to master these skills.
