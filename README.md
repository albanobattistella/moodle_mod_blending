# WORK IN PROGRESS #




**BLENDING** is a tutor-led intensive intervention for older students (middle-school to adult) with severely deficient reading skills.  Many of these students have received phonics interventions but continue to struggle.  If they read at all, it is with memorized wods and guessing.

The purpose of these drills is to help that student transition from using memorized words and guessing to sounding out. Blending and segmenting skills are the basis of ‘phonological processing’, and the lack of these skills is the basic characteristic of dyslexia. But they are just skills, and skills can be taught and learned.

**BLENDING** starts by teaching three-letter words like ‘cat’ and ‘dog’ using the five short vowels, then introduces consonant clusters and consonant digraphs using the same five short vowels, for example ‘chat’ and ‘blink’.  These drills are not intended to teach a child to read ‘cat’ and ‘dog’ – chances are that they can already do that. But if they cannot segment and blend with accuracy, automaticity, and confidence, then they will tend to rely on memorized words instead. That isn’t real reading, and must be corrected. These drills will help change that behavior.

The key to success with **BLENDING** is INTENSITY. You should only use these drills for 15-20 minutes per day but your student needs to practice EVERY DAY to master these skills.
