***BLENDING*** provides interactive blending and phonics for tutor-led *intensive* interventions for older students still reading at grade-1 or -2 level.

Most middle-school and high-school classrooms have at least one student who cannot read a grade-2 chapter book.  These students exited grade 3 without learning to read, and never received effective help.  They were passed from grade to grade, falling further and further behind.

**BLENDING** is a tutor-led intensive one-on-one intervention for these students.  It requires no special skills, and can be led by EA's, parents, or even student volunteers.  The software provides the training materials, hints for the tutors, progress monitoring, record-keeping, and continual formative assessments.

This program requires about six weeks of DAILY practice - about 20 minutes per day for drills, plus whatever time can be found for reading pracice.  In the beginning, the tutor does most of the reading, by the end the student takes over.  After six weeks, the student should be able to read a grade-3 chapterbook independently.

Of course, a high-school student cannnot thrive with grade-3 reading.  But


The intervention is based on the Torgesen and  Denton studies.  The students they recruited had often received years of phonics and other interventions without success.   readers, w and gave them 2 hours per day 'intensive' interventions.

I suggest you break the rules about reading interventions.  There is no reason to 'assess' these students

A severe reading deficit is just a compounding failure to develop component skills. Stanovich proposed to break the cascade of negative feedbacks by delivering an educational ‘surgical strike’ on one of the weak component skills, and then use it to start a positive bootstrap to other skills. He suggested the most promising target was the ability to blend and segment phonemes (‘phonological processing’).

This is exactly what we do at the Community Reading Project for students that come to us with weak phonological skills. It takes about two to three weeks of daily practice using our free Blending program to clear that roadblock. Then we jump in with fingerpoint reading of easy chapter books on top of those new phonological skills to unlock word recognition skills. Then we systematically attack comprehension, fluency, spelling, writing, and other component skills.

It sounds complicated, time-consuming, and hard. It is time-consuming, there is no short-cut. But it’s not complicated, not hard, and you can do it with your struggling reader. We’ll show you how.

Many of these students have received phonics interventions but continue to struggle.

 If they read at all, it is with memorized words and guessing.

The purpose of these drills is to help that student transition from using memorized words and guessing to sounding out. Blending and segmenting skills are the basis of ‘phonological processing’, and the lack of these skills is the basic characteristic of dyslexia. But they are just skills, and skills can be taught and learned.

**BLENDING** provides about 150 gently-progressive drills and exercises.  It starts by teaching three-letter words like ‘cat’ and ‘dog’ using the five short vowels, then introduces consonant clusters and consonant digraphs using the same five short vowels, for example ‘chat’ and ‘blink’.

Tutoring a student does not require any special training, only patience and diligence.

These drills are not intended to teach a student to read ‘cat’ and ‘dog’ – chances are that they can already do that. But if they cannot segment and blend with accuracy, automaticity, and confidence, then they will tend to rely on memorized words instead. That isn’t real reading, and must be corrected. These drills will help change that behavior.

The key to success with **BLENDING** is DAILY PRACTICE. You should only use these drills for 20 minutes per day but your student needs to practice EVERY DAY to master these skills.



Hey there!

I hope you're doing great. I wanted to share some tips on how to run an intensive reading intervention program for those who may be struggling with their reading skills. First, it's essential to assess the students' current reading levels and identify their key challenges. This will help you tailor the program to their specific needs.

Next, create a structured and consistent schedule that incorporates daily practice and regular progress monitoring. This can include small group instruction, one-on-one support, and targeted skill-building activities. Encourage active engagement and participation by using a variety of teaching strategies, such as multisensory approaches and hands-on activities.

Another important aspect is frequent communication with parents or guardians. Keep them informed about their child's progress and provide them with resources to support learning at home. Lastly, track student progress over time to make data-driven adjustments to the intervention program as needed.

I hope these tips help you create an effective intensive reading intervention program for your students. If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out!

Best regards,
Tom
