***BLENDING*** provides interactive blending and phonics for tutor-led *intensive* interventions for older students still reading at grade-1 or -2 level.

Most middle-school classrooms have at least one student who cannot make sense of a grade-2 chapter book; they have stalled and will make no further progress without an intensive intervention.  The research is clear: almost all students become strong, competent readers with proper instruction. This program specifically addresses the needs of older students.

**BLENDING** is a tutor-led intensive one-on-one intervention for these students.  It requires no special skills and can be led by EAs, parents, or even student volunteers.  The software provides hints for the tutors, progress monitoring, record-keeping, and continual formative assessments.

An intensive intervention prescribes one-on-one tutoring for at least an hour per day, ideally two hours, at least five days a week.  With this attention, students typically gain a full year of reading ability *per month*.

This program requires about ten weeks of DAILY practice - about 20 minutes per day for drills, plus increasing reading and writing practice.  By the end, the student should be set to read a grade-3 chapterbook (such as Goosebumps) independently.

Unsure if BLENDING is appropriate?  Try it for 20 minutes with your student.
