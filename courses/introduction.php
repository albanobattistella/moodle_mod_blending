            This is a sample lesson from *BLENDING*.  The real lessons will not have as many \
            annoying notes on the side.

            ***

            *BLENDING* is laser-focused on the five short vowels and the simplest CVC spelling.

            This sample lesson starts the sound %% sound('uh') %% with spelling %% spelling('u') %% as in 'but'.  \
            You should always refer to this vowel by its sound %% sound('uh') %%.

            Our notation is non-standard, but easier for tutors and parents than the IPA %% sound('É›') %% as in 'bet'. \
            The follow-up course *PHONICS* presents another dozen vowel sounds and about 150 spellings.


            ***



            We are starting the vowel %% sound('uh') %% as in But.  \
            In this course, always refer to letters by their common sound.

            Practice pronouncing %% sound('uh') %%. Make shapes with your mouth, exaggerate, play with saying it.

            Find other words that sound like 'bat'.

            Work through each of the tabs, and don't hesitate to backtrack. The last tab will be a test. ",
